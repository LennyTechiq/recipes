                <h2>Faith Kipyegon On Her Legendary Season </h2>
                <p>
                    I Have Been Focused On Writing History”, Faith Kipyegon On Becoming The First Woman To Win 1,500-5,000m World Championship Titles
                </p>
                <p>
                    Middle and long-distance runner Faith Kipyegon recently made history after becoming the first woman ever to secure double 1,500-5000 meters championship titles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Days after Kipyegon won the 1,500-meter race at the world athletics championships, Budapest 2023, the two-time Olympic gold medallist secured another win in the 5,000m competition. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two world athletics championship wins draw curtains to what has been a legendary season for the 29-year-old after she broke three world records – in the 1,500m, mile, and 5,000m.
